I have to admit, I was a sucker for the large quantity, 12 oz, when shopping for hot sauces ...but now seeing the size of the bottle, it reminds of wing-sauce bottle sizes.  Plastic bottle.  It does have a convenient squirt top.  But overall, not very hot or tasty, and made mostly from jalape&ntilde;os.  If I had seen the ingredients list I would not have bought it: Jalapenos Water Vinegar Brown Sugar Lime Juice Fish Sauce Cilantro Habanero Garlic Spice Blend Salt Potassium Sorbate Xanthan Gum
