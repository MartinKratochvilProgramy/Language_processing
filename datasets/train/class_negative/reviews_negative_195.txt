I just wanted to post here that I found small bits of plastic in this food as I was feeding my 9 month old.  Plastic!!! in food!!!! baby food!!!  So please be careful if you buy this or are considering it.  My daughter LOVES this food-- it's actually her favorite.  This is the first time we have noticed plastic in it in over 2 months.
