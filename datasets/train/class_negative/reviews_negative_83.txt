Cadbury chocolate uses a different formula in each country it is manufactured.  New Zealand is uses more cream than Australia, etc.  This version by Hershey is not what you expect from England, Australia or New Zealand Cadbury.  It does not melt on your tongue like those countries so it tastes differently.  If you are looking for the silky smooth easy melting chocolate find the non Hershey version.  Hershey has missed an opportunity to introduce high quality Cadbury chocolate to USA.
