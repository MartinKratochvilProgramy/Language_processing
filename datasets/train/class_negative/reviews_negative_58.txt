Terrible! I cannot believe this, I received this item and EVERY SINGLE BAG WAS OPENED BUT 4!!!! I'm stationed in Afghanistan and this was gonna be a snack for my team while going out on missions. I was so embarrassed when the bags were opened and spilt out all in the box, gross! And the box is filled with grease stains. Idk if it was from the airplane ride all the way here, but the box should have been more insulated and bubble wrap should have been used instead of paper. I'm very unhappy with stale crusty chips out the bag and us soldiers cannot enjoy now.
