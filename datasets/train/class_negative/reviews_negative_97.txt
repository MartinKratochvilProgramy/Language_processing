OMG I would love these cookies except for the chocolate mixed in makes it taste medicinal. DEGUSTING isn't even a strong enough word. A horrible horrible mistake...an expensive mistake....they advertised it as peanut butter cookies which is why I bought them since everyone else had peanut butter chocolate cookies when I just wanted plan peanut butter cookies....however when I received them I found out they were the chocolate peanut butter ones but I thought okay I'll try them and omg I almost threw up from the taste. HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE, DISGUTINGLY, MEDICINAL TASTE. DO NOT BUY!!! If they had a zero before the stars I would rate it a zero instead of 1 star.
