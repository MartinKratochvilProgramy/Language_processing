This is my daughter's  most favorite baby food by far.  This is the only ones she'll eat and rarely will eat the other kinds.  However, the taste is very bland, for me as an adult at least. After you put the unfinished portion in the fridge, it may become sort of watery at which point I throw it out. It is unique from the others in the combination of vegetables it has, especially zucchini. I had to update my review today, because I saw little pieces of thin stretchy plastic in two jars of this baby food.  PLASTIC IN BABY FOOD? I notified Earth's Best about it and will be sending them these pieces of plastic for testing, but I am not giving my baby this food any more, even though she likes it, that's it for us.
