If it were possible to give this product zero stars, I would have done so.  I am a huge fan of Twinings teas, and was very excited to try this new blend.  After arriving home from the grocery, I immediately started the kettle to enjoy a cup while prepping dinner.  Between sorting, washing, and chopping items, the hot water was added to the bag to steep.  Preparation continued, until a distinctly off odor hit me.  I thought one of my ingredients must be rancid!  I hunted around for almost four minutes before I realized it was the tea.  Even after cleaning up, and airing out the kitchen, my roommate later came in and asked about the smell.  Save your money to purchase ANY other Twinings product.
