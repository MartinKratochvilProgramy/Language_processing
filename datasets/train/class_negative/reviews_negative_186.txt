My daughter had extensive food allergies as an infant/toddler and we bought these bars consistently.  She still has the nut and egg allergy so I like that I can trust the manufacturer and know the food is safe.  Unfortnately the last few times we have purchased the bars (all varieties) they have been hard as a rock and my daughter won't eat them.  I have tried them myself and thought I might break a tooth. I had them on subscribe and save; which I have now cancelled and have several boxes which no one in my family will eat.  I agree with a previous post. I want to love these bars and I love everything the company stands for (and actually really like their cookies), but something has changed with these bars and they are just not even appetizing.  I hope they address the issue and I will certainly try them again if they do something to enhance the taste and address the issue with the texture. A total bummer -  they were better in the past but something changed with the taste, along with their new packaging!!
