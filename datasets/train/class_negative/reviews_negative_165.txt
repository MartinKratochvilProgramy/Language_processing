I was so excited thinking they had my favorite discontinued Kettle flavor, but was disappointed when I opened the box and found this substitution. I am keeping them but would not have ordered 15 bags of this flavor. It is a very good bbq chip but I could get this flavor at the grocery store. Why oh why do my favorite food items always get discontinued??? The one star is for the substitution. The country bbq is a 4 start chip, but not the chip I longed for.
