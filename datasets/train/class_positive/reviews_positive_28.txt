The variety packs taste great!  I have them every morning. At $0.30 cents per meal, I don't understand why everyone on earth isn't buying this stuff up.  Maple and brown sugar is terrific, followed by apples and cinnamon, followed by regular. You don't get tired of the same ole thing, and they taste great.  I just boil water from a small pot, empty the packet or 2 in a bowl, pour in boiling water, and watch it expand to 2x its size!  Taste really good and takes minutes to prepare.  Not sure why everyone on earth isn't this. Convenient, healthy, very quick, excellent quality, and extremely cheap...
